# PAGE Annotator Instructions

1. Access the [Curation tool](https://sanchezalvarado.shinyapps.io/PAGE_annotator/) to create expression observation annotations for a SINGLE publication following the [curation rules](https://github.com/planosphere/PAGE/blob/master/curation_rules.md).
2. For each instance of **homeostatic** expression fill out the following fields on the left hand side of the webpage (all fields require at least one input):
    - Transcript Accessions:  
      -  Accepts multiple inputs. Place unique transcript accessions on new lines.
      -  For any transcripts identified in the text by a name ( Wnt, FoxA, etc), for precision, locate an accession number (if reported) and input annotations with the accession number.  
      -  If the paper does not provide an accession number see the [curation rules](https://github.com/planosphere/PAGE/blob/master/curation_rules.md) for next best practice 
    -  Terms (Where Expressed): 
       -  Text box is an autocomplete field. Start typing in your term name, then select from the list.   
       -  Accepts multiple inputs. Section of more than one term from drop down list is allowed.
       -  Input MUST be present in the Planarian Anatomy Ontology, if the term does not exist, request a term addition to PLANA with a [new term request](https://github.com/obophenotype/planaria-ontology/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&te[…]t.md&title=New+Term+Request%3A+%5B+enter+your+new+name+here+%5D)  
   -  Experimental Evidence:
      -  Accepts only one input from the drop down menu
   -  Biotype:
      -  Accepts only one input from the drop down menu
   -  Life Cycle Stage:
      -  Accepts only one input from the drop down menu
   -  Specimen:
      -  Accepts only one input from the drop down menu
   -  Curator (ORCID):
      -  You must have an ORCID to participate in annotation. You can get one for free at [orcid.org](https://orcid.org/) 
   -  Pubmed ID:
      - Accepts only one input supplied by you. 
      - Preprints are not accepted at this time.     
                       
4. Once you have selected the appropriate inputs in all of the fields, click “Add Rows” at the bottom. You will see the individual records of expression in the right side of the webpage. 
5. If you have made a mistake (it happens!), click “Delete Last Row” to remove the bad record. Do scroll down on the right to make sure you have deleted the record you want and not extras! 
6. “Reset Inputs” will return the fields on the left to their default state. NOTE: All your records to the right will momentarily disappear. They are still there, add a new record and they will pop back up! 
7. When you have completed your curations for a single paper click “Download Table" and drag and drop the downloaded file to a [new PAGE issue tracker](https://github.com/planosphere/PAGE/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&template=submit-gene-expression-observation-curation.md&title=PAGE+curations+for+%5BPMID%5D). Do not rename the file.  Save this file for your records in case we contact you in the future.
