# PAGE Annotator Instructions

1. Access the [Curation tool](https://sanchezalvarado.shinyapps.io/PAGE_annotator/](https://sanchezalvarado.shinyapps.io/PAGE_annotator/) to create expression observation annotations for a SINGLE publication.
2. For each instance of **homeostatic** expression fill out the following fields on the left hand side of the webpage (all fields require at least one input):
3. Once you have selected the appropriate inputs in all of the fields, click “Add Rows” at the bottom. You will see the individual records of expression in the right side of the webpage. 
4. If you have made a mistake (it happens!), click “Delete Last Row” to remove the bad record. Do scroll down on the right to make sure you have deleted the record you want and not extras! 
5. “Reset Inputs” will return the fields on the left to their default state. NOTE: All your records to the right will momentarily disappear. They are still there, add a new record and they will pop back up! 
6. When you have completed your curations for a single paper click “Download Table" and drag and drop the downloaded file to a [new PAGE issue tracker](https://github.com/planosphere/PAGE/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&template=submit-gene-expression-observation-curation.md&title=PAGE+curations+for+%5BPMID%5D). Do not rename the file.  Save this file for your records in case we contact you in the future.
